    <h3 style="position: relative;text-align: center;">Counter Strike in eSport (history of fame)</h3>
    <p style="position: relative;text-align: left: 3%;width: 97%;"><big> Professional Counter-Strike competition involves professional gamers competing in the first-person shooter game series Counter-Strike.
      <br><br>
     The original game, released in 1999, is a mod developed by Minh "Gooseman" Le and Jess Cliffe of the 1998 video game Half-Life, published by Valve.
      <br><br>
      Currently, the games that have been played competitively include Counter-Strike (CS also called CS 1.6), Counter-Strike: Condition Zero (CS:CZ), Counter-Strike: Source (CS:S) and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). Counter-Strike has nearly 20 years of competitive history beginning with the original Counter-Strike. Tournaments for game series have been hosted since 2000. The first major was hosted in Dallas, Texas at the 2001 Cyberathlete Professional League Winter Championship, won by Ninjas in
      Pyjamas. The tournament offered a $150,000 prize pool.
      <br><br>
      In 2002, Koreaâ€™s World Cyber Games joined the competitive scene of Counter-Strike, followed by France's Electronic Sports World Cup in 2003. These tournaments were the dominate majors of Counter-Strike esports through 2007 and featured strong rivalries among top-level teams. CPL ceased operation in 2008. Another league, ESL, then added Counter-Strike to its Intel Extreme Masters (IEM) series. These tournaments continued for four years. The final major update to Counter-Strike was the 1.6 version in 2003, which became known as Counter-Strike 1.6 (CS 1.6).
      <br><br>
      Valve had struggled to iterate on CS 1.6 because of its high skill ceiling and elegant gameplay. The Counter-Strike Xbox release had limited success as compared to that of Halo and Call of Duty. The first official sequel was Counter-Strike: Source, released on November 1, 2004. The game was criticized by the competitive community, who believed the game's skill ceiling was significantly lower than that of CS 1.6. This caused a divide in the competitive community as to which game to play competitively.
      <br><br>
      The release of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) in 2012 changed the competitive scene of Counter-Strike, defining two eras of tournament play. Initially, the game was criticized by the competitive community for imbalanced gameplay, poor mechanics and bugs. However, within several months the gameplay improved after updates from Valve. The advent of video game streaming services such as UStream, Justin.tv and Twitch increased the popularity of competitive Counter-Strike. On September 16, 2013, Valve announced a US$250,000 community-funded prize pool for its first CS:GO Major Championship; the money was funded through the Arms Deal Update, which offers players in-game cosmetics. Valve also announced that the first Major, known as DreamHack Winter 2013, would take place in Sweden. The Valve-sponsored Majors would go on to be the most important and prestigious tournaments in the Global Offensive esports scene.
      <br><br>
      In October 2015, a number of professional esports organizations with Counter-Strike teams announced the formation of a trade union that set several demands for future tournament attendance. The announcement was a publicly posted email written by Alexander Kokhanovsky, CEO of Natus Vincere, that was sent to organizers of major esports events. Teams that were part of the union included Natus Vincere, Team Liquid, Counter Logic Gaming, Cloud9, Virtus.pro, Team SoloMid, Fnatic, Ninjas in Pyjamas, Titan and Team EnVyUs. Teams in this union would not attend Counter-Strike: Global Offensive tournaments with prize pools of less than $75,000. In 2016, the World eSports Association (WESA) was founded by ESL with many esports teams, including Fnatic, Natus Vincere, Team EnVyUs and FaZe Clan, though FaZe Clan left soon after the league's formation. In its announcement, WESA said it would "further professionalize eSports by introducing elements of player representation, standardized regulations, and revenue sharing for teams". They also planned to help fans and organizers by "seeking to create predictable schedules."
      <br><br>
      Valve's decisions have a strong influence on the competitive metagame. Decisions such as the removal of maps and inclusions of new ones are sometimes met with criticism. In 2016, Valve was "heavily criticized" for the removal of the map Inferno and its replacement, Nuke, in the competitive map pool. Valve has also implemented new coaching rules restricting the ability of communication between coaches and players during a match, and has increased the duration of each round and bomb timer.
      <br><br>
      By 2014, 25 million copies of the Counter-Strike series were sold. The game's fan base remains strong.</big>
